# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game that’s simple yet strategic. Played on a 3x3 grid, the game involves two players, typically using symbols X and O.
The goal is to place three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line before their opponent does. Despite its straightforward rules, Tic Tac Toe encourages players to think ahead and anticipate their opponent’s moves. A perfect game from both sides always results in a draw, making it an ideal introduction to concepts of strategy and problem-solving.
